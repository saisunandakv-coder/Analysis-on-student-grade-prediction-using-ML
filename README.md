# Analysis-on-student-grade-prediction-using-ML

Project Overview

This project applies machine learning regression models to predict students‚Äô final grades in the Portuguese language, using demographic, family, and academic factors. The dataset was taken from Portuguese secondary school students, containing 649 instances and 33 features.

The study compares multiple regression techniques to identify the most accurate model for grade prediction.
